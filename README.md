# Using Dagger in your Android app

This folder contains the source code for the "Using Dagger in your Android app" codelab.

The codelab is built in multiple GitHub branches but I modified my branch.

# Introduction
Dependency injection is a technique widely used in programming and well suited
to Android development. By following the principles of dependency injection, you
lay the groundwork for a good app architecture.

Implementing dependency injection provides you with the following advantages:
* Reusability of code.
* Ease of refactoring.
* Ease of testing.


# Pre-requisites
* Experience with Kotlin syntax.
* You understand Dependency Injection and know what the benefits
of using Dagger in your Android app are.

# Getting Started
1. Install Android Studio, if you don't already have it.
2. Download the sample.
3. Import the sample into Android Studio.
4. Build and run the sample.
